# Predict Customer Clicked Ads Classification

### Introduction

A company in Indonesia aims to determine the effectiveness of an advertisement they have launched. This is crucial for a company operating in the digital marketing consulting field to gauge the reach of their marketed ads and attract customers to view the ads. The company seeks to extract insights regarding user behavior from the collected data by creating visualizations, developing a relevant machine learning model to meet their needs, and providing recommendations based on the findings.

### Data Overview

| Attribute                | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Daily Time Spent on Site | Amount of time the user spends on the site daily (likely in minutes or hours).                  |
| Age                      | Age of the user.                                                                                |
| Area Income              | Income level in the user's residential area (likely in currency units).                         |
| Daily Internet Usage     | Amount of daily internet consumption by the user (likely in MB or GB).                          |
| Male                     | Binary indicator representing the gender of the user (e.g., 1 for male, 0 for female).           |
| Timestamp                | Date and time of the activity or interaction, possibly indicating when the ad was clicked.      |
| Clicked on Ad            | Binary indicator representing whether the user clicked on the ad (e.g., 1 for clicked, 0 for not clicked). |
| City                     | City where the user resides.                                                                    |
| Province                 | Province or state where the user resides.                                                       |
| Category                 | Category of the ad or product being advertised.                                                 |

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Import Packages**: Importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
2. **Load Dataset**: Reading the dataset named "Clicked Ads Dataset.csv" containing information related to customer interactions with online ads.
3. **Check Duplicate Rows**: Identifying and printing duplicate rows in the dataset.
4. **Check Missing Values**: Identifying and displaying missing values in different columns.
5. **Convert Timestamp**: Converting the "Timestamp" column to a datetime data type.
6. **Handle Missing Values**: Filling missing values in the "Daily Time Spent on Site" column based on the median of the respective age group.
7. (Further steps may include data exploration, visualization, modeling, etc., but the code preview does not provide details beyond this point.)

### Interpretation
- **Data Cleaning**: The analysis begins with essential data cleaning, including handling duplicates and missing values. This ensures the data quality needed for further analysis.
- **Timestamp Conversion**: Converting the timestamp provides a better understanding of temporal patterns, potentially revealing insights into customer behavior over time.
- **Age-Based Imputation**: Filling missing values based on age group median is a thoughtful strategy that preserves the underlying distribution and relationships within the data.

### Business Recommendations
1. **Investigate Duplicate Entries**: Depending on the context, duplicate rows may indicate data entry errors or legitimate repeated interactions. Understanding this could improve data accuracy.
2. **Analyze Customer Behavior Over Time**: The timestamp conversion enables temporal analysis, which can uncover trends, seasonality, or time-based patterns in customer behavior.
3. **Leverage Age-Based Insights**: The age-based imputation strategy suggests that age may be an important feature. Exploring further how age correlates with customer behavior could lead to targeted marketing strategies.
4. **Further Exploration and Modeling**: The notebook likely continues with exploratory data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling. Implementing these stages could lead to actionable insights into which factors most influence ad clicks, enabling more effective ad placement and design.
